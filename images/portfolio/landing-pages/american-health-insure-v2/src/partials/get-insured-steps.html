            <p class="get-insured-body">Simply enter your zip code above to begin. Whether you are eligible for income
                based subsidies or not, interested in shopping on a state or federal exchange or not, we can help. <strong>And
                what's more, our service is 100% free to you.</strong><br><br>
                Please be aware that neither {{ domain }}, nor the agents who contact you are
                representatives of the federal or state government. The health quotes they offer you may include a
                combination of state and federal exchange plans along with private health plans. Not every consumer is
                eligible for health insurance subsidies, and the agent you speak with will help you determine your
                eligibility.</p>
