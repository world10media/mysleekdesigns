            <p class="body-content">Building security by providing you and your loved ones with the protection and
                coverage you need is what health insurance is all about. Today’s insurance plans cover essential health
                benefits and offer a wide range of consumer protections (and protection from escalating health care and
                drug costs).<br><br>
                Health insurance may be confusing and intimidating, what with subsidies, penalties, qualifying events,
                special enrollments. The reality, though, is that getting health insurance is increasingly becoming
                easier to get. Gone are the days where insurance companies could charge more for or deny coverage due to
                a pre-existing condition. The same goes for insurance companies being able to impose limitations or caps
                on the maximum coverage allowed for a specific illness, condition, or care.<br><br>
                There are many types of plans to choose from (HMO, PPO, POS, etc.), each with unique features. Before
                you make any decisions concerning your health and health insurance, you should do your due diligence by
                gathering as much information as possible about your household income, the plans and their features, and
                assess your health care and prescription medication needs. Review the plans to learn if your current
                doctors, hospitals, and pharmacy are in the network. Then review the plans for deductibles, premiums,
                and out-pocket maximums and copayments. Then talk with a licensed insurance professional who can help
                you make an informed buying decision to maximize your benefits and save you time and money.</p><input type="submit" form="form1" onclick="" id="submit" value="Get Your Quotes" class="secondary button body-content-button md-padding"/></div></div></article>
