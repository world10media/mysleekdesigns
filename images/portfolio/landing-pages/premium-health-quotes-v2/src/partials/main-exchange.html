            <p class="text-center body-content md-padding">There are a number of health plans available on the federal
                exchanges or marketplace, ranging from lower quality, but more affordable options to more expensive
                plans with better coverage. Lower premium plans will higher deductibles, less benefits and larger
                out-of-pocket costs. All plans provide at least ten essential health benefits including free
                preventative services.<br><br>
                The cost of your health care on the Health Insurance Exchange depends on many factors, but the primary
                ones are income and what type of plan you want to purchase. If you choose to enroll in the marketplace,
                you will be able to apply for tax credits and subsidies that can reduce your overall health insurance
                costs.</p>
            <p class="text-center body-content md-padding">The bottom line is you need health insurance. First off, it’s
                the law, you have to have it. But second, and more importantly, today, medical care is very expensive.
                Health insurance is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.<br><br>
                Consider this: according the U.S. government, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to repair; the average
                cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000; and, comprehensive cancer care can cost tens of
                thousands of dollars, if not much, much more. Without insurance, you would be responsible for these
                expenses with your care. Unfortunately, expensive medical bills often lead people into deep personal
                debt or even bankruptcy — in fact, medical expenses are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the
                U.S.!<br><br>
                Health insurance provides important financial protection should you have a serious accident or illness.
                Solid, quality health insurance helps limit your out-of-pocket expenses, helping you save a lot of
                money. And given the climbing cost of health care and prescription drugs these days, you really can’t
                afford to be without health insurance. No one knows when illness or injury will strike and being
                uninsured could seriously impact both your health and finances. While many people think of health
                insurance as something you can only use when you are sick, it is much, much more than that. Health
                insurance can help you maintain your health and prevent serious illnesses or conditions. By taking
                advantage of routine preventative and wellness screenings, you can avoid illness from occurring, or with
                early detection limit the severity. Insurance can provide you with routine care that helps you manage
                existing conditions better. So you see, having health insurance can help to improve the quality of your
                life.</p>
