                    <p class="sm-padding">Most people are interested in saving money when possible. It’s no different
                        when it comes to health insurance and health care. We want the best available but we don’t
                        necessarily want, nor can we afford, high rates on our health insurance or expensive medical
                        care.<br><br>
                        Medical care and prescription drug costs are climbing and there’s little chance that’s going to
                        stop anytime soon. So while we may not have any ability to control those things, we do have ways
                        we can lower our share of those costs and the impact they have on our finances.</p>

                        <li>You may qualify for federal subsidies that can help reduce premiums, co-pays, coinsurance,
                            and deductibles.
                        </li>
                        <li>You or your child may qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the

                        </li>
                        <li>If you’re under 26 you may be able to stay on your parent’s health insurance plan.</li>
                        <li>If you’re under 30, you may be able to purchase a ‘catastrophic’ coverage plan with a high
                            deductible, low premium plan.Catastrophic plans are the cheapest plan that
                            qualifies as minimal essential coverage. These plans cover emergencies, which, if you’re a
                            healthy individual, is all you may need.
