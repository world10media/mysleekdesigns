            <span class="lead">Data We Collect</span>
            <strong>Governing Law</strong><br>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws
            principles. <br><br>

            <span class="lead">ARBITRATION</span>
            All disputes arising out of or relating to any purchase you make with via this Site, any information you
            provide via the Site, these Terms (including the formation,
            performance or alleged breach), and your use of the Site will be exclusively resolved under confidential
            binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the
            American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
            Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then in effect at
            the time of the dispute. <br><br>

            The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, {{ web
            }} will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee
            which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified {{ web }} in writing and provided a copy
            of the arbitration proceedings. However, if {{ web }} is
            the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees
            and costs to {{ web }}. If for any reason the AAA is
            unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted
            in the city of Hollywood, Florida, but may proceed
            telephonically if the claimant so chooses. <br><br>

            The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
            arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these
            Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or
            otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
            relief in state or federal court located to enforce these Terms
            or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights. In the event equitable relief is sought, each party
            hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of
            such court. <br><br>

            <span class="lead">WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS</span>
            ANY DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE VIA THE SITE,
            THESE TERMS (INCLUDING THEIR FORMATION, PERFORMANCE OR
            ALLEGED BREACH), AND YOUR USE OF THE SITE SHALL BE SUBMITTED INDIVIDUALLY BY YOU, AND SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT
            TO ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE STATUS. BY ENTERING
            INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS
            or participate as a member of a class of claimants with
            respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that
            this class action waiver is material and essential to the
            arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims.
            If any portion of this class action waiver is limited,
            voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU
            UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY
            ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST {{ web }} IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
            PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
