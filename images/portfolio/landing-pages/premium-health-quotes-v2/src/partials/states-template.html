                <br><br>Given these numbers, it’s clear that Alabama’s population was in poor health and health coverage was difficult for most residents to obtain. This may have been due in part to high unemployment for the state. As of March, 2010, Alabama’s unemployment was at 11 percent, and many families had been forced off their employer-based health insurance and found themselves unable to afford COBRA benefits. Unfortunately, that only accounted for a small portion of Alabama’s families. The reality was that many thousands of the state’s residents never had health insurance, and that continues to the be the case today.
                <br><br>Alabama has over 4.8 million residents. The average cost of an inpatient hospital stay before insurance is $1,486 per day based on 2014 data, according to The Henry J.
