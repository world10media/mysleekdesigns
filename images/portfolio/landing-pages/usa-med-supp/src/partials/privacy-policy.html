        <p>{{ company }}, through its {{ web }} website (“Site”) is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of each user that visits our
            website. Your privacy rights are important to us and we are committed to respecting your online privacy and making sure that any information you share with us by using
            our
            website is
            properly protected.
            <br><br>

            We have established this {{ web }} Privacy Policy so you know the importance we place on your privacy and so you can understand how we collect and use information
            collected from you when you visit our website or submit any personally identifiable information to us. This policy describes our overall privacy practices regarding
            information we collect on our web sites and through other Internet mediums. Our policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control.

            <span class="lead">Data We Collect</span>
            When you visit our website, we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable information through various sources.  PII means any
            information that may be used
            to identify an individual, including but not limited to name, address, and telephone number.  Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, contact or
            locate an individual, including
            but not limited to zip code, gender, and age.
            <br><br>

            When you use the Site, we automatically collect certain information from you, such as your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome); your Internet domain,
            (e.g., Comcast, Time Warner, etc.); your computer’s operating system, (e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux); referring and exit page; operating system; the type of
            mobile device you use (if applicable); your mobile device’s unique device ID; and your IP address.  This information lets us see how users find our Site, and it tells
            us which pages users visit most frequently so we can make our Site more useful. We keep this information for an indefinite amount of time to improve the operation of
            our Site and to provide better services to our users.
            <br><br>

            In addition to the data that your browser or Internet session sends us automatically, we may also collect PII if you enter it when using our website. This contact
            information is stored on our
            servers and used to fulfill your information request. If you have not opted out of its use, we may share it with our data licensees, including our advertising clients
            and their vendors, and other advertising partners.
